# gutenberg-blockstrapper
### Added Custom Value Block Constructor in block5.js
PHP will need something to parse the custom blocks still. Also the js isn't quite right yet, notes in the file comments.

#### Changed Name to Blockstrapper from Blockstrap
To avoid confusion with the blockchain software going by the name Blockstrap.

Made this specifically to work with underscores because the Gutenberg Editor keeps destroying the content in the Classic editor of my site. Seems to have limited functionality with other WordPress themes.

Have fun with it. I'd like to try and make the block elements created dynamic in the editor, so users can specify their own Bootstrap classes.

There's a bunch of commented out junk that was part of the way to accomplishing my goal. Have to sit-down and give it a proper planning.
